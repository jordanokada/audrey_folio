The dangerous attacking trio will continue to trip players up and breeze past everyone. They will dribble past defenders, cross beautiful balls, and never fail to finish on the frame. Their chemistry on the field makes all the difference off the pitch as well. Sophia Smith, Mallory Swanson, and Trinity Rodman are the dynamic three on the US women's national soccer team and continue to leave an impact on the African American sports experience. Kim Crabbe, and  Briana Scurry other black female soccer athletes before them, walked so the trio could run. Each individual makes measurable progress individually, but together they make an incredible difference in the African American Sports Experience. 

While the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team was officially founded in 1985, it was in 1986 that Kim Crabbe made history as the first Black player to join the team (10). Her inclusion marked a key moment, not just for the national squad but for the broader representation of diversity in the sport. Crabbe’s achievement emphasizes the importance of inclusivity and inspires future generations of players to see themselves in a game that is evolving. This inspired other actions to come into play, like Briana Scurry, key in advancing representation in soccer, breaking barriers of race, sex, and gender while excelling as one of the sport’s greatest goalkeepers. As the first Black woman and first woman goalkeeper inducted into both the FIFA and National Soccer Halls of Fame, Scurry has paved the way for athletes from underrepresented communities to see themselves in professional soccer. Her achievements include a historic save during the 1999 FIFA Women’s World Cup Final Penalty Shootout, where she was the only Black starter in a championship that captivated the world (11). Scurry’s openness as one of the first out lesbian players, combined with her advocacy for equal pay and traumatic brain injury awareness, showed her role as a champion for equity and inclusion both on and off the field. Their impact truly changed the game and alleviated the opportunity for the Trio themselves. 

Sophia Smith is making a big difference in sports as a Black athlete. Growing up in Windsor, Colorado, she was often one of the only Black players on her teams, which made her curious why there weren’t more Black girls playing soccer. She was so sheltered from diversity in sports and stated “...it would make me wonder ‘Why?’ Like, where were all the Black girls? Where were the young Black girls who wanted to play soccer?” (1). It shows how her questions about the lack of representation highlight a broader issue of access and encouragement for young Black girls in the sport within Colorado. From winning a national championship at Stanford to quickly joining the USWNT, she proved that she would continue to become an inspiration for others.  In 2022, she made history as the first Black woman to win U.S. Soccer’s Female Player of the Year award (1). Now, she’s using her success to show kids of color that they can play soccer too and belong in the sport. She’s helping make soccer more open to everyone. Not only that, but outside of soccer she makes extra effort to spread inclusivity. Sophia Smith has teamed up with CLIF Bar and Outdoor Afro, a nonprofit focused on fostering Black leadership and connections in nature. Together, they are organizing outdoor events and building stronger ties within Portland's African-American community (3). Her partnership with Outdoor Afro reflects her passion for helping others, specifically in the Black community, to reconnect with nature through education, recreation, and conservation, combining her love for the outdoors with her cultural roots.

Mallory Swanson, a forward for the Chicago Red Stars, has been a key player for the U.S. Women’s National Team (USWNT) since her debut in 2016. “At just 17 years old, she became the youngest player to join the team since Heather O'Reilly in 2002” (2). Swanson represented the U.S. at the 2016 Rio Olympics, where she became the youngest American to score an Olympic goal, and solidified her legacy in 2019 by winning the FIFA Women’s World Cup. Swanson’s smile is unforgettable. Mallory Swanson has shown she cares about positivity and inspiration, using her platform to encourage young girls to pursue soccer and their dreams with confidence. Despite facing setbacks, including injuries, she remains focused on her passion for the game and her commitment to uplifting others. She stated, “...as a forward, your job is to score goals and to play up. I try to contribute the best I can, inspiring others, like girls who are playing the game now—hopefully being a role model” (8). Swanson emphasizes the importance of joy and hard work in her journey, sharing her story to motivate the next generation to find happiness and strength through soccer. 

Trinity Rodman born in 2002, is a prominent American soccer player who has made significant strides in the sport. As the daughter of NBA legend Dennis Rodman, she has carved her own path, becoming the youngest player ever drafted into the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) when selected by the Washington Spirit in 2021. Most would have expected Trinity Rodman to follow in her father’s footsteps and excel in basketball, a sport where African Americans make up 70% of the league, but instead, she followed her own path in soccer, a sport traditionally dominated by white athletes (12).  Her exceptional performance earned her the NWSL Rookie of the Year award, and she later signed a record-breaking contract, making her the highest-paid player in NWSL history. Rodman has also been a key contributor to the U.S. Women's National Team and stands out in her play style, as well as her fashion. Trinity Rodman stood out at the Olympics with super long, bright pink hair (6). Her Rapunzel-length hairstyle grabbed everyone’s attention and showed off her fun and bold personality. This matched the way she was on the pitch. Rodman also wears her hair in very authentic styles, not using chemical relaxers. This is a major issue for some black soccer athletes, who stress about fitting in. Players have highlighted the pressure to conform to white expectations and the struggle to feel fully included in these environments (9). When professional athletes like Rodman wear their hair naturally, it is reassuring and gives a sense of belonging that these athletes didn't have before.  Inspiring other black female athletes to express who they are through their hair and fashion.

The Paris 2024 Olympics, brought this trio to life. With all the watching eyes, fans fell in love with the “Triple Expresso”. Trinity Rodman came up with the "Triple Espresso" nickname, which after a bit of confusion, Sophia Smith loved because it perfectly captures their energy, feistiness, and love for coffee (3). The USWNT’s all-African-American frontline has made a lasting impact. There are even “...videos of young boys and girls wearing the trio’s jerseys” (7). The fact that the next generations of boys and girls are watching this team perform, and falling in love with the trio, shows that this sport is bringing in new fans that weren’t as prominent until this powerful trio came together. In the "Triple Espresso”, Sophia Smith, Trinity Rodman, and Mallory Swanson show how Black women are taking over women’s soccer. These three players work together so well on the field, scoring 10 of the U.S. team’s 12 goals at the Olympics, and they’re changing what soccer looks like in the U.S. and around the world. Teams like Nigeria, Zambia, Brazil, and Colombia also have Black players making milestones just as these three are (5). "Triple Espresso" isn’t just about them being great players — it’s about how they’re paving the way for more Black women to shine in soccer and making the sport even more exhilarating for the fans. They are also showing how important it is to have diversity and representation in women’s soccer. They’re proving the game is better and more exciting when players from all kinds of backgrounds are part of it. Fans everywhere love their energy and how much fun they bring to the field. They’re also inspiring young Black athletes and showing them what’s possible in soccer. Smith, Rodman, and Swanson are breaking barriers and making sure the sport is more open for future generations.

In conclusion, the contributions of Sophia Smith, Mallory Swanson, and Trinity Rodman as the "Triple Espresso" have changed the landscape of women’s soccer, showcasing the profound impact of diversity and representation. Their success on the frontline has drawn new fans to the sport while inspiring young athletes from all backgrounds. By following in the footsteps of others like Kim Crabbe and Briana Scurry, this dynamic trio is not only elevating the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team but also breaking barriers and paving the way for future generations of Black athletes to thrive in the game.
