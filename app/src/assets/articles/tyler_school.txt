Change is continuous throughout life. Especially through Tyler Scholl’s athletic journey at the University of Colorado Boulder as a track and cross-country athlete. Even through every roller coaster that his expedition has put him through, he never failed to persevere. 

Tyler Scholl, a dedicated and accomplished athlete from Kremmling, Colorado, grew up on a cattle ranch, where his off-grid lifestyle (without WiFi or phone service) helped foster his connection to nature and a strong bond with his family. He had early exposure to hard work on the ranch and running. In fact, he said “ I was a good runner because we had a really bad cow dog, and so my dad would take my sister and I off the floor wheel, and we have to go get the cows. So I was, like, naturally just running a ton” (Scholl).  His athletic journey is deeply influenced by his family, including his sister, a former All-American national champion whose giant picture on the University of Colorado Boulder’s wall of honors, which serves as a constant reminder of her achievements. 

Tyler has always been motivated by his family's legacy, including his father's Olympic rowing aspirations. He even mentioned, “Naturally, you ask a kid, you’re asked what do you want to do when you grow up? [some say] I want to be a firefighter or I want to be a nurse” while Scholl knew he wanted to be an Olympian (Scholl). Just at eight years old he was in an environment of not only wanting to be the best, but the mindset to get there. Tyler's early athletic journey began with Nordic skiing, winning the Colorado state championship as a sophomore. He later expanded his training to include running, mountain biking, Olympic weightlifting, and rowing, often alongside his father. His ambition to become an Olympian, inspired by his father's Olympic pursuit, has been a driving force throughout his career. 

When running as much as Scholl and other long-distance runners, there is inevitable injuries. Throughout his collegiate career, he has faced multiple stress fractures broken bones, which means long recovery periods, which kept him off the track for multiple months at a time. These setbacks forced him to rebuild, slowly, but his determination never diminished. He even said “My crowning achievement is that I just didn't quit because, like, it's so easy to quit” (Scholl). It took time to regain his form, and fully recover and return to the high level he was at before. Now he is in his senior year, and for the first time, Tyler finds himself injury-free, and racing at a high level. This highlights his perseverance and adaptation to these difficult injuries. After years of battling through pain, he is taking advantage of the opportunity to train at full capacity and aims to make the most of this phase in his athletic career.

Tyler Scholl’s experience with Colorado went through a dramatic shift which could have ruined his final season. For over three decades, legendary coach Mark Wetmore had shaped CU's cross-country and track programs, becoming an iconic figure for the University of Colorado. His quiet, old-school approach commanded respect and stability. However, when Wetmore unexpectedly stepped down after 31 years, it created a bunch of uncertainty for the team, with a new head coach being hired just weeks before the season started. Sean Carlson, the new coach, brought an entirely different style—he's 37, communicative, and focused on a modern, science-driven approach to training. While the drastic changes initially felt chaotic, with roster shifts and new assistant coaches joining, the transformation has rejuvenated the program, especially from Scholl’s point of view. “It was a needed change” he mentioned, which shows the kind of perceptive view he had. Scholl now says it’s more than a needed change, rather “it’s good change, and [he thinks they are] going to be like a super, freakishly good team” (Scholl). Now that he is in the new coaching staff, he is ready to learn and grow with them.

Under the new coaching, Tyler Scholl's training underwent a significant transformation, shifting from the intense, all-out interval sessions that had defined his previous years to a more measured, volume-focused approach. In the past, workouts were shorter but more explosive, with intervals pushing athletes to their limits. Now, under Coach Carlson’s leadership, Tyler and his teammates follow a "double threshold" training method, where they perform two interval sessions in a single day at a slightly reduced intensity but with much greater volume. Instead of fewer, grueling repetitions, Tyler now tackles longer sessions, like 20 intervals at a controlled pace, allowing for more consistent progress and faster recovery. This method is designed to build endurance and strength gradually, enabling athletes to handle higher mileage and remain injury-free over the long term. The change has been a lot, but for Tyler, the results speak for themselves. He even said that he took a minute off of his PR in a race, “which is, like, unheard of, that's just a huge chunk to drop in one race” (Scholl). His performances have improved, and his body is responding better to the new style of training, making it a critical shift in his development. Despite the challenges of losing a legendary coach, the change has helped Tyler's performance, allowing him to race faster and stronger than before. 

Scholl has been against all odds and still will continue to grow. There are very few athletes when faced with opposition that only become better and don’t give up. His mindset, grit, and attitude will be his compass not only in his last season at CU but through life. Tyler Scholl’s optimistic, hard-working character will guide him in the right direction to succeed and grow in athletics and in his future career when he graduates from the University of Colorado.
